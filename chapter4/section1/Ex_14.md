### 4.1.13

Suppose you use a stack instead of a queue when running breadth-first search. Does is still compute shortest paths?

**Answer**:

No. It won't compute shortest paths. If we use queue, the distance in each direction increases equally by one. Using stack will lead to going too far in a certain direction which isn't the shortest one.
