### 4.1.1

What is the maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges? What is the minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?

**Answer**:

The maximum: $$V * (V - 1) / 2$$, (every  two nodes in the graph are connected)

The minimum: $$V - 1$$, (each node has at least one edge)
