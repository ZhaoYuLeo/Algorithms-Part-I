### 4.1.6

Consider the four-vertex graph with edges 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-0. Draw an array of adjacency-lists that could not have been built calling addEdge() for these edges no matter what order.

**Answer**:

**adjacency-lists**

0 → 1 → 3 (was 0 → 3 → 1)
1 → 2 → 0
2 → 3 → 1
3 → 0 → 2

Refer to : 3-0 => 0-1 => 1-2 => 2-3 => 3-0, contradiction
