### 3.1.23 Analysis of binary search.

Prove that the maximum number of compares used for a binary search in a table of size N is precisely the number of bits in the binary representation of N, because the operation of shifting 1 bit to the right converts the binary representation of N into the binary representation of ⎣N/2⎦.

**Answer**:

The maximum number of compares used for a binary search is lgN + 1 which is precisely the number of bits in the binary representation of N.
