### 3.1.21 Memory usage

Compare the memory usage of BinarySearchST with that of SequentialSearchST for N key-value pairs, under the assumptions described in Section 1.4. Do not count the memory for the keys and values themselves, but do count references to them. For BinarySearchST, assume that array resizing is used, so that the array is between 25 percent and 100 percent full.

**Answer**:

- `BinarySearchST` (16 overhead)

```java
private Key[] keys; (8 reference)
private Value[] vals; (8 reference)
private int N = 0; (4 + 4 padding)
```

For each array:

16 bytes of object overhead which includes a reference to the object's class, garbage collection information, and the synchronization information.

4 bytes for the length

4 bytes of padding

`8*array.length` bytes for the references

Sum up: 16 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 4 + (16 + 4 + 4 + [8N, 32N]) * 2 = 88 + [16N, 64N] bytes



- `SequentialSearchST` (16 overhead)

```java
private Node first; (8 reference)
private int N = 0;

private class Node {
  	Key key;
  	Value val;
    Node next;
}
```

A nested non-static (inner) class such as Node class requires an extra 8 bytes of overhead (for a reference to the enclosing instance).

Sum up: 16 + 8 + 4 + 4 + (16 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8) * N = 32 + 48N bytes
