### 3.2.20

Prove that the running time of the two-argument keys() in a BST with N nodes is at most proportional to the tree height plus the number of keys in the range.

**Answer**:

```java
private void keys(Node x, Queue<Key> queue, Key lo, Key hi) {
    if (x == null) {
        return;
    }
    int cmplo = lo.compareTo(x.key);
    int cmphi = hi.compareTo(x.key);
    if (cmplo < 0) {
        keys(x.left, queue, lo, hi); // A
    }
    if (cmplo <= 0 && cmphi >= 0) {
        queue.enqueue(x.key);  // B
    }
    if (cmphi > 0) {
        keys(x.right, queue, lo, hi); // C
    }
}
```

A: go down and left til we meet the ceiling(lo), Then B

B: if ceiling(lo) <= hi, enqueue it into the queue, Then C

C: if ceiling(lo) < hi, go down and right repeat the process. After we finished, return successively.



The running  time of step A is at most proportional to the left subtree height. Some keys larger than lo maybe not included in the range (larger than hi). Step B enqueue different keys in the range. The running time of Step C is at most proportional to the right subtree height and repeat the process.
