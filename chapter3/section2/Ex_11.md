### 3.2.11

How many binary tree shapes of N nodes are there with height N? How many different ways are there to insert N distinct keys into an initially empty BST that result in a tree of height N? (See Exercise 3.2.2.)

**Answer**:

N = 3:

01. 1
     \
      2
       \
        3

02.     3
       /
      2
     /
    1

03. 1
     \
      3
     /
    2

04.  3
    /
   1
    \
     2

N = 4:

01. 1
     \
      2
       \
        3
         \
          4

How to create the binary tree with N nodes and N height?

[1, 2, 3, ..., N - 1, N]

2(choose 1 or N as the first element) * 2(choose(2 or N) or (1 or N - 1) as the second element) * ... * 1 = 2^(N - 1)

Each way will produces a different shape of tree.
