Prove that no <u>compare-based</u> algorithm can build a BST using fewer than lg(N !) ~ N lg N compares.

**Answer**:

Build a BST(binary search tree) with N nodes:

In the best case we are inserting one node into a perfect balanced binary search tree and try to build a perfect balanced binary search tree.
            o
         /     \
        o       o
       / \     / \
      o   o   o   o
     / \ / \ / \ / \
~~The number of compares would be: $0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + ... + h = \sum_0^h x\times2^x = (x-1)2^{x+1} + 2$~~

The number of compares would be: $\lfloor lg(1)\rfloor + \lfloor lg(2) \rfloor + \lfloor lg(3) \rfloor + ... + \lfloor lg(N) \rfloor < lg(N!) < lg(N^N) = Nlg(N)$
