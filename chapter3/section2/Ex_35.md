### 3.2.35 Reﬁned analysis

Refine the mathematical model to better explain the experimental results in the table given in the text. Speciﬁcally, show that the average number of compares for a successful search in a tree built from random keys approaches the limit $$2lnN + 2\gamma - 3\approx 1.39lgN – 1.85$$ as N increases, where $$\gamma = .57721...$$ is Euler’s constant. Hint : Referring to the quicksort analysis in Section 2.3, use the fact that the integral of $$1/x$$ approaches $$ln N + \gamma$$ .

**Answer**:

Let $$C_N$$ be the total internal path length of a BST built from inserting N randomly ordered distinct keys. We have $$C_0 = C_1 = 0$$ and for $$N > 1$$ we can write:

$C_N = N - 1 + (C_0 + C_{N-1}) / N + (C_1 + C_{N - 2})/N + (C_2 + C_{N - 3})/N + ... + (C_{N-1} + C_0)/N$

The tree is built from random keys. Thus the left subtree may have any number of elements in the range of [0, N-1] with equal probability. The root contributes 1 to the path length of each of the other $$N-1$$ nodes.

$NC_N = N(N - 1) + 2(C_0 + C_1 + ... + C_{N-2} + C_{N-1})$

$(N-1)C_{N-1} = (N-1)(N-2) + 2(C_0 + C_1 + ... + C_{N-2})$

Subtracting the first equation from the second one gives:

$\Large\frac{C_N}{(N+1)} = 2(\frac1{N+1}-\frac1{N(N+1)}) + \frac{C_{N-1}}{N}$

$\Large\frac{C_N}{(N+1)} = 2(\frac2{N+1}-\frac1{N}) + \frac{C_{N-1}}{N}$

The harmonic serise $$\sum_{k=1}^N \frac1{k}$$ up to $$1/N$$ is approximately $lnN + \gamma$. Then we have:

$C_N \thicksim 2(N+1)(2ln(N+1) + 2\gamma - lnN-\gamma -2/2 - 2/1 + 1)$

The average cost of a search hit is $$1 + C_N / N$$ so we have the limit  $$2lnN + 2\gamma - 3$$.
