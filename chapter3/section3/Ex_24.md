Worst case for red-black BSTs. Show how to construct a red-black BST demonstrating that, in the worst case, almost all the paths from the root to a null link in a red-black BST of N nodes are of length 2 lg N.

**Answer**:

The worst case is a 2-3 tree that is all 2-nodes except that the leftmost path is made up of
3-nodes. The path taking left links from the root is twice as long as the paths of length ~lgN
that involve just 2-nodes. 

The red-black BST is constructed by inserting keys in descending order. As shown in the video below:

n=190

height = 12

average depth = 6.0

n=254

height = 13

average depth = 6.5
