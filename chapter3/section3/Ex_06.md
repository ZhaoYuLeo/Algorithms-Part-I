Find the probability that each of the 2-3 trees in EXERCISE 3.3.5 is the result of the insertion of N random distinct keys into an initially empty tree.

**Answer**:

N = 6:

N = 7:

add 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to the diagram {(234567), (134567), ...} above.

(a):
      ●●
  ●●  ●●  ●

P(7a) =  12 / 21 = 4 / 7

(b):

      ●
    ●   ●
  ● ●   ● ●

P(7b) = 9 / 21 = 3 / 7


N = 8:

(a):

     ●●
 ●●  ●●  ●●

P(8a) = (4 / 7) * (2 / 8) = 1 / 7

(b):

      ●
   ●     ●
 ●  ●  ●  ●●

P(8b) = (3 / 7) + (4 / 7) * (6 / 8) = 6 / 7


N = 9:

(a):

      ●
   ●     ●
 ●●  ●  ●  ●●

P(9a) = P(8a) * (3 / 9) + P(8b) * (4 / 9) = 3 / 7


(b):

      ●
   ●     ●
 ●  ●  ●●  ●●


P(9b) = P(8a) * (6 / 9) + P(8b) * (2 / 9) = 2 / 7

(c):

        ●
    ●       ●●
  ●   ●   ●  ●  ●

P(9c) = P(8b) * (3 / 9) = 2 / 7

N = 10:

(a):

        ●
    ●       ●
 ●●  ●●   ●  ●●

P(10a) = P(9a) * (4 / 10) + P(9b) * (4 / 10) + P(9c) * 0 = 2 / 7

(b):

         ●
     ●●     ●
  ●  ●  ●  ●  ●●

P(10b) = P(9a) * (6 / 10) + P(9b) * 0 + P(9c) * (4 / 10) = 13 / 35

(c):

         ●
    ●●      ●
 ●  ●  ●●  ●  ●

P(10c) = P(9a) * 0 + P(9b) * (6 / 10) + P(9c) * (6 / 10) = 12 / 35
