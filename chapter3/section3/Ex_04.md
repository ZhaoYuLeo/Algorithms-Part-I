### 3.3.4

Prove that the height of a 2-3 tree with N keys is between $\sim\lfloor log_3 N\rfloor$

$.63lgN$ (For a tree that is all 3-nodes) and $\sim \lfloor lgN\rfloor$ (for a tree that is all 2-nodes).



**Answer:**

The worst case is a 2-3 tree that is all 2-nodes. The best case is a 2-3 tree that is all 3-nodes. Such that the height of the tree with N keys is between $\sim\lfloor log_3 N\rfloor$ and $\sim \lfloor log2N\rfloor$.
