### 1.5.8

Give a counterexample that shows why this intuitive implementation of union() for quick-find is not correct:

```java
public void union(int p, int q) {
    if (connected(p, q)) return;

    // Rename p’s component to q’s name.
    for (int i = 0; i < id.length; i++)
        if (id[i] == id[p]) id[i] = id[q];
    count--;
}
```



Answer:

id[p] will be changed into id[q]. After it changed, id[i] which equals to the original id[p] would never be found.

0	1	2	2	4	5	2	5	8	9

`union(2, 5)` will result in:

0	1	5	2	4	5	2	5	8	9

But not:

0	1	5	5	4	5	5	5	8	9
