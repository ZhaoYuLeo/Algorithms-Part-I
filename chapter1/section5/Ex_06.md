### 1.5.6

Estimate <u>the minimum amount of time</u> (in days) that would be required for <u>weighted quick-union</u> to solve a <u>dynamic connectivity</u> problem with $10^9$ sites and $10^6$ input pairs, on a computer capable of executing $10^9$ instructions per second. 

Assume that each iteration of the inner for loop requires 10 machine instructions.

```java
private int find(int p) {
    // Follow links to find a root.
    while (p != id[p]) p = id[p];
    return p;
}

public void union(int p, int q) {
    int i = find(p);
    int j = find(q);
    if (i == j) return;

    // Maks smaller root point to larger one.
    if (sz[i] < sz[j]) {
        id[i] = j;
        sz[j] += sz[i];
    } else {
        id[j] = i;
        sz[i] += sz[j];
    }
    count -= 1;
}
```



Answer:

In the best case, the tallest tree is 2. 

In the worst case, the tallest tree is $log_2N$ , $N$ is the number of connected sites.

Since we want to estimate the minimum amount of time, I guess we need to consider the best case and the machine instructions of `find` and `union` operations would be one constant $x \in \N$.

The time required to solve would be:

$$10^6 x \div 10^9 = x10^{-3} \ (seconds) = x \ (milliseconds)$$ 



For the worst case, we always union the leaf of two trees of the same height. The machin instructions required would be something like:

$$ {log_2^{10^6}}(x_1\sum_{n=0}^{log_2^{10^6}} 2^{-n} + x_2\sum_{n=0}^{log_2^{10^6} -1} (n + 1)2^{-n})$$, $x_1$ refers to the machine instructions outside the while loop, $x_2$ refers to the machine instructions inside the while loop.
