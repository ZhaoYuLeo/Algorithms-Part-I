### 1.5.9
Draw the tree corresponding to the id[] array depicted at right. Can this be the result of running weighted quick-union? Explain why this is impossible or give a sequence of operations that results in this array.

i	     	 0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9

-----

id[i]		1	1	3	1	5	6	1	3	4	5

Impossible:

1. $log_210 < 4$ , The tree is higher than 4.
2. We will add one tree to another's root without changing the shape. Since 6 has subtree, it must have been a root of one tree, but we cannot find it.
