### 1.5.5
Estimate the <u>minimum amount of time (</u>in days) that would be required for <u>quick-Ô¨Ånd</u> to solve a <u>dynamic connectivity problem</u> with $10^9$ sites and $10^6$ input pairs, on a computer capable of executing $10^9$ instructions per second.

Assume that each iteration of the inner for loop requires 10 machine instructions.



Answer:

$$(10^9 \times 10 ) \ (instructions/pair) \times 10^6 (pairs) = 10^{16} (instrucitions)$$

$$10^{16}\ (insructions) \div 10^9 (instruction/seconds) \div 3600 (seconds/hour) \div 24 (hours/day) \approx 115.74 (days)$$

Thus, 115 days would be required.
