### 1.4.13

Using the assumptions developed in the text, give the amount of memory needed to represent an object of each of the following types:
    a. Accumulator
    

    b. Transaction
    
    c. FixedCapacityStackOfStrings with capacity C and N entries
    
    d. Point2D
    
    e. Interval1D
    
    f. Interval2D
    
    g. Double

**Answer:**

Typical Java implementations use 8-bit bytes, representing each char value with 2 bytes (16 bits), each int value with 4 bytes (32 bits), each double and each long value with 8 bytes (64 bits), and each boolean value with 1 byte (since computers typically access memory one byte at a time).
We assume that 8 bytes are needed to represent addresses, as is typical for 64-bit architectures that are now widely used, recognizing that many older machines use a 32-bit architecture that would involve just 4 bytes per machin address.

**a. Accumulator**

```java
public class Accumulator {
    private double total;
    private int N;
    ...
}
```

16  overhead + 8  double + 4  int + 4  padding (bytes) = 32 bytes

**b. Transaction**

```java
public class Transaction {
    private final String who;
    private final Date when;
    private final double amount;
    ...
}

```

- Transaction object: 

16  overhead + 8  object reference [who] + 8  object reference [when] + 8  double (bytes) = 40 bytes

- String object which "who" refers to:

16  overhead + 8 char[] reference + 4 offset + 4 count + 4 hash + 4 padding  (bytes) = 40  bytes

- char[]:

16  overhead + 4  array length + 4 padding + 2x (bytes) = 24 + 2x bytes

- Date object which "when" refers to :

16  overhead + 4  int + 4  int + 4  int + 4  padding (bytes) = 32 bytes

adds up to  136 + 8n bytes (depending on the char array)

**c. FixedCapacityStackOfStrings with capacity C and N entries**

```java
public class FixedCapacityStackOfStrings {
    private String[] a;
    private int N;

    public FixedCapacityStackOfStrings(int cap) {
        a = new String[cap];
    }
    ...
}
```

- FixedCapacityStackOfStrings object:

16  overhead + 8  object reference [a] + 4  int + 4  padding (bytes) = 32 bytes

- String Array a:

16  overhead + 4  array length + 4  padding + 8C  entries address (bytes) = 24 + 8C bytes

- Strings stored in a:

 N * (16  overhead + 8 char[] reference + 4  offset + 4  count + 4  hash + 4 padding) (bytes) = 40N bytes 

- char[]:

Depending. 16 overhead + 4 array length + 4 padding + 2x (bytes) = 24 + 2x bytes

adds up to $56 + 8C + 40N + (24 + 2x_0)x_1 (bytes)$ 

**d.Point2D**

`Point2D(double x, double y)`

16  overhead + 8  double + 8  double (bytes) = 32 bytes

**e. Interval1D**

`Interval1D(double lo, double hi)`

16  overhead + 8  double + 8  double (bytes) = 32 bytes

**f. Interval2D**

`Interval2D(Interval1D x, Interval1D y)`

16  overhead + 8 object reference + 8 object reference +  32  x object  + 32  y object = 96 bytes 

**g. Double**

16  overhead + 8  double (bytes) = 24 bytes
