### 1.4.13

Using the assumptions developed in the text, give the amount of memory needed to represent an object of each of the following types:
    a. Accumulator
    
    b. Transaction
    
    c. FixedCapacityStackOfStrings with capacity C and N entries
    
    d. Point2D
    
    e. Interval1D
    
    f. Interval2D
    
    g. Double


Answer:

Typical Java implementations use 8-bit bytes, representing each char value with 2 bytes (16 bits), each int value with 4 bytes (32 bits), each double and each long value with 8 bytes (64 bits), and each boolean value with 1 byte (since computers typically access memory one byte at a time).
We assume that 8 bytes are needed to represent addresses, as is typical for 64-bit architectures that are now widely used, recognizing that many older machines use a 32-bit architecture that would involve just 4 bytes per machin address.

a. Accumulator
```
public class Accumulator {
    private double total;
    private int N;
    ...
}
```java


16 bytes overhead + 8 bytes double + 4 bytes int + 4 bytes padding = 32 bytes

b. Transaction
```
public class Transaction {
    private final String who;
    private final Date when;
    private final double amount;
    ...
}
```java

16 bytes overhead + 8 bytes object reference + 8 bytes object reference + 8 bytes double = 40 bytes

c. FixedCapacityStackOfStrings with capacity C and N entries

```
public class FixedCapacityStackOfStrings {
    private String[] a;
    private int N;

    public FixedCapacityStackOfStrings(int cap) {
        a = new String[cap];
    }
    ...
}
```java

16 bytes overhead + 8 object reference + 24 bytes header information + 8N entries + C

d.Point2D
