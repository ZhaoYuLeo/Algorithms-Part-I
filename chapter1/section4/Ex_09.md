### 1.4.9

Give a formula to predict the running time of a program for a problem of size N when doubling experiments have shown that the doubling factor is $2^b$ and the running time for problems of size $N_0$ is T.



**Answer:**

$$f(2N) =  2^bf(N)$$

$$f(N_0) = T$$ 



$$f(N) = 2^bf(N/2) = 2^{2b}f(N/4)=... = 2^{kb}f(N/2^k) $$

$$N/2^k = N_0, k = lg(N/N_0)$$

$$f(N) = 2^{blg(N/N_0)}T = (N/N_0)^bT$$
