### 1.4.1
Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is precisely N (N-1)(N-2)/6.

Hint : Mathematical induction.

Answer:
f(k) represents the number of different triples that can be chosen from k items


for k:
f(k) = g(k-1) + f(k-1); g(k-1) is the number of different tuples chosen from k-1 items
     = (k-1)(k-2)/2 + (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)/6
     = k(k-1)(k-2)/6

for k-1:
f(k-1) = (k-1)(k-2)(k-3)/6

......

for 4:
f(4) = 4

for 3:
f(3) = 1

for 2:
f(2) = 0
