### 1.2.8

Suppose that a[] and b[] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of integers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efﬁcient?

```java
int [] t = a;
a = b;
b = t;
```

A. Swaps a and b by swapping references.

> Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efﬁcient because it does so by copying references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.
