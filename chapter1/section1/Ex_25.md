### 1.1.25

Prove that Euclidâ€™s algorithm computes the greatest common divisor of any pair of nonnegative integers p and q.

Induction
The greatest common divisor of p and q is the greatest common divisor of p % q and q.
Repeating the process would lead to 0.
When p % q == 0, p is the greast common divisor of p and q.
