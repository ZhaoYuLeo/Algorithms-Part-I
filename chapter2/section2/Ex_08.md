### 2.2.8

Suppose that the Algoritsm 2.4 is modiﬁed to skip the call on merge() whenever $a[mid] <= a[mid+1]$. Prove that the number of compares used to mergesort a sorted array is linear.



```java
sort(a, lo, mid);
sort(a) mid + 1, hi);
merge(a, lo, mid. hi);
```



**Answer**:

Given a sorted array, Let C(N) be the number of compares needed to sort an array of length N. C(0) = C(1) = 0, and for N > 0, we have C(N) = 2C(N/2) + 1. (treat $a[mid] <= a[mid + 1]$ as one comparison.)

$C(N) + 1 = 2C(N/2) + 2 = 2(C(N/2) + 1) = 2^n(C(1) + 1) = N$

which is linear.
