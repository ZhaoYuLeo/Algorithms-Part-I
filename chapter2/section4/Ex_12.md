### 2.4.12

Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum operations, but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?

**Answer**:

Ordered array. Find the maximum is constant time.
