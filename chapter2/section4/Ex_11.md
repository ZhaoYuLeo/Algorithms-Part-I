### 2.4.11

Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?

**Answer**:

Unordered array which takes O(1) time to insert.

Solution: Unordered array. Insert is constant time.
