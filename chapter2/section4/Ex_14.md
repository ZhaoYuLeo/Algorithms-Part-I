### 2.4.14

What is the minimum number of items that must be exchanged during a remove the maximum operation in a heap of size N with no duplicate keys? Give a heap of size 15 for which the minimum is achieved. Answer the same questions for two and three successive remove the maximum operations.

**Answer**:


2, it's two.

       30
    /      \
   29       21

 6    5   8    18
/ \  / \ / \   / \
1 2  3 4 7  0 11  15


remove the maximum 30, exch(1, 15), exch(1, 2).

 6    5   19    18
/ \  / \ / \   / \
1 2  3 4 7  0 11  15

remove the maximum 30, exch(1, 15), exch(1, 2);
remove the maximum 29, exch(1, 14), exch(1, 3), exch(3, 6).

(I hope the last items can exchange with pq[2] otherwise it will definitely fall to the bottom)
(But we cannot repeat this process because pq[2] will be less than pq[3] after we make the exchange)

remove the maximum 30, exch(1, 15), exch(1, 2);
remove the maximum 29, exch(1, 14), exch(1, 3), exch(3, 6);
remove the maximum 21, exch(1, 13), exch(1, 3), exch(3, 7).
