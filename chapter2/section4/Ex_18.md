### 2.4.18

In MaxPQ, suppose that a client calls insert() with an item that is larger than all items in the queue, and then immediately calls delMax(). Assume that there are no duplicate keys. Is the resulting heap identical to the heap as it was before these operations? Answer the same question for two insert() operations (the first with a key)

**Answer**:

With no duplicate keys, the resulting heap will be identical to the original one.

Assume we have a heap like the following one:
     30
   /     \
 28       15  
 / \     /  
11  13  14

After we insert() an item in pq[7] which is larger than all items, swim() will exchange the position of the parent node of pq[7] with pq[7] successively until the new inserted node reaches the root of the tree. Then we delete this node. Since one of the children of the maximum was once the maximum, pq[1](pq[6]) will exchange position with the old root which eventually return to the original state. We can inserted twice the largest item and delete twice but the shape of the tree won't change because when shink() make choice between the two child nodes, it will always choose the child which was the parent of the other one.
