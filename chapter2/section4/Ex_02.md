### 2.4.2

Criticize the following idea: To implement find the maximum in constant time, why not use a stack or a queue, but keep track of the maximum value inserted so far, then return that value for find the maximum?

**Answer**:

After we return that value for find the maximum, we need to find the largest item in the rest which can't be achieved in constant time using a simple stack or a queue.

*Solution*. Will need to update the maximum value from scratch after a remove-the-maximum operation.
