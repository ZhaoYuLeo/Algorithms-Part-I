### 2.4.32 Lower bound

Prove that it is impossible to develop a compare-based implementation of the MinPQ API such that both insert and delete the minimum guarantee to use ~Nlog logN compares.

**Answer**:

2.2 Proposition I. No compare-based sorting algorithm can guarantee to sort N items with fewer than $$lg(N!) \thicksim NlgN$$ compares. $$N! \leqq number\ of\ leaves \leqq 2^h$$.

**Solution**: 

This would yield an $$n log\ log n$$ compare-based sorting algorithm (insert the $$n$$ tiems, then repeatedly remove the minimum), violating the proposition of Section 2.3.
