For N = 32, give arrays of items that make heapsort use as many and as few compares as possible.

**Answer**:

```java
public static void sort(Comparable[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    for (int k = N/2; k >= 1; k-= 1) {
        sink(a, k, N);
    }
    while (N > 1) {
        exch(a, 1, N--);
        sink(a, 1, N);
    }
}
```

Worst case: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... , 31. 103 compares;

Best case: 31, 30, 29, 28, 27, ... , 1, 0. 31 compares.
