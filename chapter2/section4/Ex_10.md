### 2.4.10

Suppose that we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered array pq[], putting the largest value in pq[0], its children in pq[1] and pq[2], and so forth, proceeding in level order. Where are the parents and children of pq[k]?

**Answer**:

The parents of pq[k] : pq[(k - 1) / 2];

The children of pq[k]: pq[2 * k + 1], pq[2 * k + 2].
