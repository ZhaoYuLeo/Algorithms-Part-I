###  2.1.15 Expensive exchange.

A clerk at a shipping company is charged with the task of rearranging a number of large crates in order of the time they are to be shipped out. Thus, the cost of compares is very low (just look at the labels) relative to the cost of exchanges (move the crates). The warehouse is nearly full—there is extra space sufﬁcient to hold any one of the crates, but not two. What sorting method should the clerk use?


Answer:

Selection sort!. $N^2$ compares with N exchanges. Extra space for only one crate is enough.
