 ### 2.2.3

Chebyshev's inequality says that the probability $Pr$ that a random variable $X$ is more than $k$
 standard deviations $\sigma$ away from the mean $\mu$ is less than $1/k^2$. For $N = 1$ million, use
 Chebyshev's inequality to bound the probability that the number of compares used by
 quicksort is more than 100 billion ($.1\ N^2$).



**Answer:**

 Chebyshev's inequality: $\Pr(\left|X-\mu \right|\geq k\sigma )\leq {\frac  {1}{k^{2}}}$.

$N = 1000000$.

The average $\mu$ number of compares is  $2N ln N \approx 1.39N lgN$, 39 percent higher than in the best case.

the standard deviation $\sigma$ of the number of compares is about $.65 N$.

$\Pr(\left|X- 2N ln N \right|\geq k.65N )\leq {\frac  {1}{k^{2}}}$.

$\Pr(X \geq 2NlnN + k.65N | X \leqq 2NlnN - k.65N )\leq {\frac  {1}{k^{2}}}$.



$\Pr(X \geq 100000000000 )\leq {\frac  {1}{k^{2}}}, k = 153888.6631094091$

The probability is less and equal than 4.222666146061757e-11.
