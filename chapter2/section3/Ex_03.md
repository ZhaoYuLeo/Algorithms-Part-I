### 2.3.3

What is the maximum number of times during the execution of `Quick.sort()` that the largest item can be exchanged, for an array of length N?

**Answer:**



9 <smaller than 9>    <smaller than 9> 9

1 9 0 <bigger than 1>       0 1 9 <bigger than 1>        0 1 <bigger than 1> 9

​                                       sorted ↑



2 9 4 1 <bigger than 2>    1 2 4 9 6 3 <bigger than 4>   1 2 3 4 6 9 8 5 <bigger than 5>  1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 7

​                                       sorted ↑                                         sorted  ↑                                               sorted  ↑ 

(2 9 4 1 6 3 8 5 7); advance 2 steps; N / 2



sorted a b c d e f g largest h i j k  =>    

​            ↑ elements bigger than a between [b..g] will be changed into elements smaller than a.
