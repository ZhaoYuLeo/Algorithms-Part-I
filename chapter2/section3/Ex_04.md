### 2.3.4

Suppose that the initial random shuffle is omitted. Give six arrays of ten elements for which `Quick.sort()` uses the <u>worst-case number of compares.</u>



**Answer:**



[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 63 compares = 11 + 10 + 9 + ... + 3 = (14 * 9) / 2 = 63

[8, 9] needs 3 compares = less(a[9], v) + less(a[9], v) + less(a[8], v), i = 9, j = 8.







[9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], 58 compares = 10 + 10 + 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 2 = 58

[0, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9]  (0, 9, 9)

[0, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9] (0, 0, 8)

[0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 9] (1, 8, 8)

[0, 1, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 8, 9] (1, 1, 7)

[0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7, 8, 9] (2, 7, 7)

[0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3, 7, 8, 9] (2, 2, 6)

[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] (3, 6, 6)

[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] (3, 3, 5)

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] (4, 5, 5)

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
