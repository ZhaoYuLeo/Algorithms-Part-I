### 2.3.13

What is the recursive depth of quicksort, in the best, worst, and average cases? This is the size of the stack that the system needs to keep track of the recursive calls. See Exercise 2.3.20 for a way to guarantee that the recursive depth is logarithmic in the worst case.

**Answer**:

best: logarithmic
worse: linear
