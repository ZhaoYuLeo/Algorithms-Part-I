### 2.5.1

Consider the following implementation of the compareTo() method for String. How does the third line help with efÔ¨Åciency?

```java
public int compareTo(String that) 
{
  if (this == that) return 0; // this line 
  int n = Math.min(this.length(), that.length());
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) 
  {
    if (this.charAt(i) < that.charAt(i)) return -1; 
    else if (this.charAt(i) > that.charAt(i)) return +1;
  } 
  return this.length() - that.length();
}
```



**Answer**:

If they refer to the same string, we can get the answer immediately rather than comparing them in O(N) time.



*Solution*: it avoid directly comparing individual characters if `s` and `t` are references to the same string.
